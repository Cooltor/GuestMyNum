## What's this project ?

It's a little Game in JavaScript. I code this game to learn JavaScript and the manipulation with the DOM.
This project is proposed by Jonas Shmedtmann in his course of JS.
I've change the CSS a little and I add the name option.

## What's you need ?

You need an IDE, VS Code for me.

## Version :

Only HTML and CSS for now
